# The Bird May Die
## Poem by Forough Farrokhzad

I feel sad,
I feel blue.  

I go outside and rub my cold fingers-  
on the sleek shell of the silent night.

I see that all lights of contact are dark,  
All lanes to relate us- are blocked.

Nobody will introduce me to the sun,  
Nobody will take me- to the gathering of doves.

Keep the flight in mind,  
The bird may die.

# What does the bird care
## Song by Hanoch Levin

The tree is tall, the tree is green
The sea is salty, the sea is deep
If the sea is deep, what does the tree care?
What does the sea care that the tree is green?
 
the tree is tall, the tree is green
A beautiful bird, she will fly far away
If the bird flies, what does the tree care?
What does the bird care that the tree is green?
 
The sea is salty, the sea is deep
A beautiful bird, she will fly far away
If the bird flies away, what does the sea care?
What does the bird care that the sea is deep?
 
A man sings songs because the tree is green
A man sings songs because the sea is deep
If the bird flies away, he won't sing any more songs
What does the bird care if he sings or is slient?
