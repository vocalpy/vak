# `vak`

## a neural network toolbox for animal vocalizations and bioacoustics

```{image} images/song_with_colored_segments.png
```

`vak` is a library that makes it easier
for researchers studying animal
vocalizations---such as birdsong, bat calls,
and even human speech---to work with
neural network algorithms.

Currently, the main use is automated **annotation** of animal vocalizations.
By **annotation**, we mean something like this example of annotated birdsong:

```

Please see links below for information on how to get started and how to use `vak` to
apply neural network models to your data.
