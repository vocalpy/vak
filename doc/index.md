# `vak`

## a neural network toolbox for animal vocalizations and bioacoustics

```{image} images/song_with_colored_segments.png
```

`vak` is a library that makes it easier
for researchers studying animal
vocalizations---such as birdsong, bat calls,
and even human speech---to work with
neural network algorithms.

To learn more about the goals and design of vak, 
please see this talk from the SciPy 2023 conference, 
and the associated Proceedings paper 
[here](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2023/pdfs/david_nicholson.pdf).

Currently, the main use is automated **annotation** of animal vocalizations.
By **annotation**, we mean something like this example of annotated birdsong:

Please see links below for information on how to get started and how to use `vak` to
apply neural network models to your data.

### {ref}`get-started-index`

If you are new to working with `vak`,
and you're looking for installation instructions and a tutorial,
{ref}`start here <get-started-index>`.

### {ref}`howto-index`

If there is something specific you're trying to do,
like use your own spectrogram files or annotation formats with `vak`,
please check in the {ref}`howto-index`.

### Getting Help

For help, please begin by checking out the {ref}`faq`.

To ask a question about vak, discuss its development, 
or share how you are using it, 
please start a new "Q&A" topic on the VocalPy forum 
with the vak tag:
