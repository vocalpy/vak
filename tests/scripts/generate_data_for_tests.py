"""script run by Makefile test-data-generate command

makes all the 'generated' test data, i.e. files created by vak,
It's called 'generated' test data to distinguish it from the
'source' test data, i.e., files **not** created by vak, that is,
the input data used when vak does create files (csv files, logs,
neural network checkpoints, etc.)

This script generates:
* temporary config.toml files used when generating results
* `prep`d (prepared) datasets, and results created with those datasets,
  both of which were generated using the temporary config.toml files

all the setup configs send output to one of two places:
for any prep command, the output goes to some child directory of ./tests/data_for_tests/generated/prep
for any command run with a `prep`d dataset, the output goes to some child dir of ./tests/data_for_tests/generated/results

examples:
    when we run `vak prep tests/data_for_tests/generated/configs/test_train_audio_wav_annot_birdsongrec.toml`
    the `prep`d dataset will be in a new directory created in
    `./tests/data_for_tests/generated/prep/train/audio_wav_annot_birdsongrec`

    when we run `vak train tests/data_for_tests/genereated/configs/test_train_audio_wav_annot_birdsongrec.toml`
    it will use the `prep`d dataset csv that's now in
    `./tests/data_for_tests/generated/prep/train/audio_wav_annot_birdsongrec`, that the temporary config.toml points to,
    and the results will go to a new directory created in
    `./tests/data_for_tests/generated/results/train/audio_wav_annot_birdsongrec`

To set up this directory structure, we iterate through the constants defined below.

The constants are:
- TOP_LEVEL_DIRS
    name of sub-directories in .tests/data_for_tests/generated that correspond to
    either tempory config files, 'prep'd datasets, or `results` generated from those `prep`d datasets
- COMMAND_DIRS
    names of sub-sub-directories in ./tests/data_for_tests/generated/prep &
    ./tests/data_for_tests/generated/results that correspond to cli commands;
    e.g., dataset from running `vak prep $A_TRAIN_CONFIG.TOML` will be in
    ./tests/data_for_tests/generated/prep/train/audio_{}_annot_{}
- DATA_DIRS
    names of "subsub"directories in ./tests/data_for_tests/$COMMAND that correspond to toy test data sets;
    those sub-directories contain test data generated by $COMMAND using the specified toy test data set

In other words, the parent directory for all the generated directories we need to remove
will have a path of the form: `./tests/data_for_tests/$TOP_LEVEL_DIRS/COMMAND_DIRS/DATA_DIRS`.
For example:
The prep`d dataset from running `vak prep $AUDIO_CBIN_ANNOT_NOTMAT_CONFIG.TOML` will be in
`./tests/data_for_tests/prep/train/audio_cbin_annot_notmat`
and corresponding results will be in
`./tests/data_for_tests/results/train/audio_cbin_annot_notmat`
The directories will have names with timestamps like `prep_20201015_1115`.
Those are the generated directories we want to remove.
