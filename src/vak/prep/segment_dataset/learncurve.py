    """Make subsets of the training data split for a learning curve.

     Makes subsets given a dataframe representing the entire dataset,
     with one subset for each combination of (training set duration,
     replicate number). Each subset is randomly drawn
     from the total training split.

     Uses :func:`vak.prep.split.segment_dataset` to make
     subsets of the training data from ``dataset_df``.

     A new column will be added to the dataframe, `'subset'`,
     and additional rows for each subset.
     The dataframe is returned with these subsets added.
     (The `'split'` for these rows will still be `'train'`.)

     Parameters
     ----------
     dataset_df : pandas.DataFrame
         Dataframe representing a dataset for frame classification models.
         It is returned by
         :func:`vak.prep.segment_dataset.prep_segment_dataset`,
         and has a ``'split'`` column added.
     train_set_durs : list
         Durations in seconds of subsets taken from training data
         to create a learning curve, e.g., `[5., 10., 15., 20.]`.
     num_replicates : int
         number of times to replicate training for each training set duration
         to better estimate metrics for a training set of that size.
         Each replicate uses a different randomly drawn subset of the training
         data (but of the same duration).
     dataset_path : str, pathlib.Path
         Directory where splits will be saved.

     Returns
     -------
     dataset_df_out : pandas.DataFrame
         A pandas.DataFrame that has the original splits
         from ``dataset_df``, as well as the additional subsets
         of the training data added, along with additional
         columns, ``'subset', 'train_dur', 'replicate_num'``,
         that are used by :mod:`vak`.
         Other functions like :func:`vak.learncurve.learncurve`
         specify a specific subset of the training data
         by getting the subset name with the function
         :func:`vak.common.learncurve.get_train_dur_replicate_split_name`,
         and then filtering ``dataset_df_out`` with that name
         using the 'subset' column.
