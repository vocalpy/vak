    """Prepare a dataset of segments for a VAE model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_dir : str, Path
        Path to directory with files from which to make dataset.
    dataset_path
    dataset_csv_path
    purpose : str
        Purpose of the dataset.
        One of {'train', 'eval', 'predict', 'learncurve'}.
        These correspond to commands of the vak command-line interface.
    audio_format : str
        Format of audio files. One of {'wav', 'cbin'}.
        Default is ``None``, but either ``audio_format`` or ``spect_format``
        must be specified.
    spect_params : dict, vak.config.SpectParams
        Parameters for creating spectrograms. Default is ``None``.
    annot_format : str
        Format of annotations. Any format that can be used with the
        :module:`crowsetta` library is valid. Default is ``None``.
    annot_file
    labelset : str, list, set
        Set of unique labels for vocalizations. Strings or integers.
        Default is ``None``. If not ``None``, then files will be skipped
        where the associated annotation
        contains labels not found in ``labelset``.
        ``labelset`` is converted to a Python ``set`` using
        :func:`vak.converters.labelset_to_set`.
        See help for that function for details on how to specify ``labelset``.
    context_s : float
        Number of seconds of "context" around segment to
        add, i.e., time before and after the onset
        and offset respectively. Default is 0.005s,
        5 milliseconds.
    max_dur : float
        Maximum duration for segments.
        If a float value is specified,
        any segment with a duration larger than
        that value (in seconds) will be omitted
        from the dataset. Default is None.
    target_shape : tuple
        Of ints, (target number of frequency bins,
        target number of time bins).
        Spectrograms of segments will be reshaped
        by interpolation to have the specified
        number of frequency and time bins.
        The transformation is only applied if both this
        parameter and ``max_dur`` are specified.
        Default is None.
    train_dur : float
        Total duration of training set, in seconds.
        When creating a learning curve,
        training subsets of shorter duration
        will be drawn from this set. Default is None.
    val_dur : float
        Total duration of validation set, in seconds.
        Default is None.
    test_dur : float
        Total duration of test set, in seconds.
        Default is None.
    train_set_durs : list
        of int, durations in seconds of subsets taken from training data
        to create a learning curve, e.g. [5, 10, 15, 20].
    num_replicates : int
        number of times to replicate training for each training set duration
        to better estimate metrics for a training set of that size.
        Each replicate uses a different randomly drawn subset of the training
        data (but of the same duration).
    spect_key : str
        key for accessing spectrogram in files. Default is 's'.
    timebins_key : str
        key for accessing vector of time bins in files. Default is 't'.
