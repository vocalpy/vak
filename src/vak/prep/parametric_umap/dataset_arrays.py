    This is run *after* calling :func:`vak.prep.unit_dataset.prep_unit_dataset`
    to generate ``dataset_df``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset_df : pandas.DataFrame
        A ``pandas.DataFrame`` returned by
        :func:`vak.prep.unit_dataset.prep_unit_dataset`
        with a ``'split'`` column added, as a result of calling
        :func:`vak.prep.split.unit_dataframe` or because it was added "manually"
        by calling :func:`vak.core.prep.prep_helper.add_split_col` (as is done
        for 'predict' when the entire ``DataFrame`` belongs to this
        "split").
    dataset_path : pathlib.Path
        Path to directory that represents dataset.
    purpose: str
        A string indicating what the dataset will be used for.
        One of {'train', 'eval', 'predict', 'learncurve'}.
        Determined by :func:`vak.core.prep.prep`
        using the TOML configuration file.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    The ``DataFrame`` is modified in place
    as the files are moved, so nothing is returned.
