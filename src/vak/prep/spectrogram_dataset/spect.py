    Parameters
    ----------
    dat : numpy.ndarray
        audio signal
    samp_freq : int
        sampling frequency in Hz
    fft_size : int
        size of window for Fast Fourier transform, number of time bins.
    step_size : int
        step size for Fast Fourier transform
    transform_type : str
        one of {'log_spect', 'log_spect_plus_one'}.
        'log_spect' transforms the spectrogram to log(spectrogram), and
        'log_spect_plus_one' does the same thing but adds one to each element.
        Default is None. If None, no transform is applied.
    thresh: int
        threshold minimum power for log spectrogram
    freq_cutoffs : tuple
        of two elements, lower and higher frequencies.
    min_val : float, optional
        Minimum value to allow in spectrogram.
        All values less than this will be set to this value.
        This operation is applied *after* the transform
        specified by ``transform_type``.
        Default is None.
    max_val : float, optional
        Maximum value to allow in spectrogram.
        All values greater than this will be set to this value.
        This operation is applied *after* the transform
        specified by ``transform_type``.
        Default is None.
    normalize : bool
        If True, min-max normalize the spectrogram.
        Normalization is done *after* the transform
        specified by ``transform_type``, and *after*
        the ``min_val`` and ``max_val`` operations.
        Default is False.

    Return
    ------
    spect : numpy.ndarray
        spectrogram
    freqbins : numpy.ndarray
        vector of centers of frequency bins from spectrogram
    timebins : numpy.ndarray
