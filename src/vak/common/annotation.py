    Notes

    This function encapsulates logic for handling different types of
    annotations; it determines whether each row has a separate annotation file,

    If the latter, then the function opens that file and makes sure that
    each row from the dataframe can be paired with an annotation
    (using :func:`vak.annotation.map_annotated_to_annot`).
    If instead there is a unique annotation file per row in the dataframe,
    the format of the annotation files is determined with
    :func:`vak.annotation.format_from_df` and then each file is opened
    with :module:`crowsetta` -- in other words, we assume the mapping
    was already done when preparing the dataset, and that each row contains
    an annotation file paired with the file it annotates.

    """Map annotated files,
    i.e. audio or spectrogram files,
    to their corresponding annotations.

    This function implements the three different ways that
    vak can map annotated files to their annotations.
    The first is when a single annotation file contains
    multiple annotations, and so the format by necessity
    must include the file annotated by each annotation.
    The second assumes that the annotated file can be determined
    programmatically by removing the extension from the annotation file,
    e.g. 'bird1.wav.csv' -> 'bird1.wav'.
    The third assumes that the annotated file can be determined
    by replacing the extension of the annotation file
    with the extension of the annotated file,
    e.g. 'bird1.csv' -> 'bird1.wav'.

    Returns a :class:`dict` where each key
    is a path to an annotated file,
    and the value for each key
    is a :class:`crowsetta.Annotation`.

    Mapping is done with two helper functions,
    :func:`~vak.annotation._map_using_notated_path` and
    :func:`~vak.annotation._map_using_ext`.

    The function :func:`~vak.annotation._map_using_notated_path`
    is used for annotation formats that include
    the name of the annotated file.
    The names of these formats (in :module:`crowsetta`) are:
    {'birdsong-recognition-dataset', 'generic-seq', 'yarden'}.

    The other function is are used for all other formats,
    and it assumes a one-to-one mapping from annotation file
    to annotated file.
    It assumes that the name of the annotated file
    can be found by removing the extension of the annotation
    format, e.g., 'bird1.wav.csv` -> 'bird1.wav'.
    The second, that is used if the first fails,
    assumes the name of the annotated file
    can be found by replacing the extension of the annotation
    format with the extension of the annotated files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    annotated_files : list
        Of paths to audio or spectrogram files.
    annot_list : list
        Of Annotations corresponding to files in annotated_files
    annotated_ext : str
        Extension of annotated files.
        Default is None, in which case this function will
        look for extensions of any valid audio format
        (listed as ``vak.constants.VALID_AUDIO_FORMAT``).
        Specifying the format provides a slight speed up.
