def prep(toml_path):
    """prepare datasets from vocalizations.
    Function called by command-line interface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    toml_path : str, Path
        path to a configuration file in TOML format.
        Used to rewrite file with options determined by this function and needed for other functions

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Notes
    -----
    Saves a .csv file representing the dataset generated from data_dir.

    Datasets are used to train neural networks that segment audio files into
    vocalizations, and then predict labels for those segments.
    The function also prepares datasets so neural networks can predict the
    segmentation and annotation of vocalizations in them.
    It can also split a dataset into training, validation, and test sets,
    e.g. for benchmarking different neural network architectures.

    If the 'purpose' is set to 'train' or 'learncurve', and/or
    the duration of either the training or test set is provided,
    then the function attempts to split the dataset into training and test sets.
    A duration can also be specified for a validation set
    (used to measure performance during training).
    In these cases, the 'split' column in the .csv
    identifies which files (rows) belong to the training, test, and
    validation sets created from that Dataset.

    If the 'purpose' is set to 'predict' or 'eval',
    or no durations for any of the training sets are specified,
    then the function assumes all the vocalizations constitute a single
    dataset, and for all rows the 'split' columns for that dataset
    will be 'predict' or 'test' (respectively).
