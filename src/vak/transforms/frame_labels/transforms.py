"""Class forms of transformations
related to frame labels,
i.e., vectors where each element represents
a label for a frame, either a single sample in audio
or a single time bin from a spectrogram.

These classes call functions from
``vak.transforms.frame_labels.functional``.
Not all functions in that module
have a corresponding class,
just key functions needed by
dataloaders and models.

- FromSegments: transform to get frame labels from annotations
- ToLabels: transform to get back just string labels from frame labels,
  used to evaluate a model.
- ToSegments: transform to get segment onsets, offsets, and labels from frame labels.
    Used to convert model output to predictions.
    Inverse of ``from_segments``.
- PostProcess: combines two post-processing transforms applied to frame labels,
  ``remove_short_segments`` and ``take_majority_vote``, in one class.
