"""functional forms of transformations
related to labeled timebins,
i.e., vectors where each element represents
a label for a time bin from a spectrogram.

This module is structured as followed:
- from_segments: transform to get labeled timebins from annotations
- to_labels: transform to get back just string labels from labeled timebins,
  used to evaluate a model
- to_segments: transform to get back segment onsets, offsets, and labels from labeled timebins.
  Inverse of ``from_segments``.
- post-processing transforms that can be used to "clean up" a vector of labeled timebins
  - to_inds_list: helper function used to find segments in a vector of labeled timebins
  - remove_short_segments: remove any segment less than a minimum duration
  - take_majority_vote: take a "majority vote" within each segment bounded by the "unlabeled" label,
    and apply the most "popular" label within each segment to all timebins in that segment
  - postprocess: combines remove_short_segments and take_majority_vote in one transform
