class WindowDataset(VisionDataset):
    """Dataset class that represents all possible windows
     of a fixed width from a set of spectrograms.
     The underlying dataset consists of spectrograms
     of vocalizations and annotations for those vocalizations.

    Returns windows from the spectrograms, along with labels for each
    time bin in the window, derived from the annotations.

    Abstraction that enables training on a dataset of a specified duraiton.

        of crowsetta.Annotation instances,
        loaded from from DataFrame that represents dataset, using vak.annotation.from_df.

        A function/transform that takes in the target and transforms it.

    Notes
    -----
    This class uses three vectors to represent
    a dataset of windows from spectrograms, without actually loading
    all the spectrograms and concatenating them into one big matrix.
    The three vectors correspond to this imaginary, unloaded big matrix:
    (1) `spect_id_vector` that represents the 'id' of any spectrogram in this matrix,
    i.e., the index into spect_paths that will let us load it, and
    (2) `spect_inds_vector` where the elements represents valid indices of windows
    we can grab from each spectrogram. Valid indices are any up to the index n, where
    n = number of time bins in this spectrogram - number of time bins in our window
    (because if we tried to go past that the window would go past the edge of the
    spectrogram).
    (3) `x_inds` is our 'training set' vector, just a set
    of indices (0, 1, ..., m) where m is the length of vectors (1) and (2).

    When we want to grab a batch of size b of windows, we get b indices from x,
    and then index into vectors (1) and (2) so we know which spectrogram files to
    load, and which windows to grab from each spectrogram

            name of split from dataset to use
        labelmap : dict
            that maps labels from dataset to a series of consecutive integers.
            To create a label map, pass a set of labels to the `vak.utils.labels.to_map` function.
        window_size : int
            number of time bins in windows that will be taken from spectrograms
        spect_key : str
            key to access spectograms in array files. Default is 's'.
        timebins_key : str
            key to access time bin vector in array files. Default is 't'.
        spect_id_vector : numpy.ndarray
            represents the 'id' of any spectrogram,
            i.e., the index into spect_paths that will let us load it
        spect_inds_vector : numpy.ndarray
            valid indices of windows we can grab from each spectrogram
        x_inds : numpy.ndarray
            indices of each window in the dataset. The value at x[0]
            represents the start index of the first window; using that
            value, we can index into spect_id_vector to get the path
            of the spectrogram file to load, and we can index into
            spect_inds_vector to index into the spectrogram itself
            and get the window.
        transform : callable
            A function/transform that takes in a numpy array
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, a SpectScaler instance.
            Default is None.
        target_transform : callable
            A function/transform that takes in the target and transforms it.

        Returns

        initialized instance of WindowDataset
