def map_from_config_dict(config_dict, model_names):
    """map a list of model names to model configuration sections from a
    config.toml file.

    Given the configuraiton in a dict and a list of model names, returns dict that
    maps model names to config sections. If no section in the config.toml file
    matches the model name, an error is raised.

    Used to get configuration for only the models specified
    in a certain section of config.toml file, e.g. in the TRAIN section.

    The returned model-config map can be used with vak.models.from_model_config_map
    (and the number of classes and input shape) to get a list of model instances
    ready for training.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config_dict : dict
        configuration from a .toml file, loaded into a dictionary
    model_names : list
        of str, i.e. names of models specified by a section

        specifying their configuration: hyperparameters such as learning rate, etc.

    Returns

        where each key is the name of a model and the corresponding value is
        a section from a config.toml file.
